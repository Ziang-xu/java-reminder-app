# Todo list 

Todo list application for the group project of COMP2100, 19S2. 
###
Dirction for use:  
###
   We developed the Todo/Reminders application for this project. Users can add, delete and edit todo items, set time reminders, and mark reminders as completed, and add the item to google calendar. 
   ###
   The main activity shows a list of all todo/reminder items added by the user, with the ability to show and hide completed todo items. Users can choose the completed switch on the list to decide if this item is completed. Users can also check their current location by clicking the map button. This can help users to check if they are near the items loation. 
   ###
   By click the add button, users can open the added view and add a new item. Users can set a future date and time for a reminder and select a location from the map. A system notification will be shown to the user with the todo item's title and note, reminding them to take action on the todo item. Additionally, users can open a map by clicking the get location buttonto select one point from the map as the item location. 
   ###
   Users can also edit the items after they are created. After users click the item they want to change, the edit view will be opened. Users can edit the item's title, reminder date and time, and the notes/body. Users can mark todo items as completed by selecting the Completed switch located next to each todo item in the list shown in the main activity. Todo items marked as completed will be hidden from the main view. If the users want to check all items, they can click the "Show Completed" button on the main view and all items will be shown. Users can long-click on a todo item in the list to delete the todo, and a confirmation dialog will be displayed before the todo is deleted. After a todo item has been deleted by the user, any scheduled reminders/notifications will not be shown to the user.
### 
   When adding new todo items, users can choose to add the new item to the default calendar by using the "Add to Calendar" checkbox. If the "Add to Calendar" box is checked, the application will open the default Calendar application (Google Calendar) and prompt the user to add a new event. The item's title, notes/body, and reminder date and time will be copied to this event, and the user will be able to modify the event before adding it to the Calendar.
